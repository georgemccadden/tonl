# TONL Imagery

TONL seeks to transform the idea of stock photography by displaying images of diverse people and their stories around the world.

Our voices and visibility matter. Photography and storytelling can help humanize and hopefully diminish the stereotypes and prejudice against black and brown people, especially. TONL wanted to challenge the stale, homogenous look of traditional stock photography by showcasing the many ethnic backgrounds of every day people.

## Image Components

As a full-stack engineer at TONL I optimized browsable imagery load-time by building standalone GUI components collaboratively with UX and design teams using Reactâ€™s JSX extension.

Examples of these GUI components are image modals used to show categorical imagery shot by some of the incredible photographers TONL hires.
